I have tested this version myself, but results are not as good as original version. My Voron 2.4 350 may not be the best machine to test that so leaving to community to test.
# Instrunctions
- Print with Voron parts settings (optional: use Arachne for better letters visibility)
- Insert heat inserts, but make sure that surface is as flat as possible, use sandpaper or exacto knife to remove any
- Parts have L and R letters so attach them accordingly
